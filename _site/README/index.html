<h1>My Personal Website</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.danielepaletti.com">danielepaletti.com</a></p>
<p>This <strong>website works without JS</strong>.</p>
<p>Everything has been developed from scratch with <strong>CSS and HTML</strong>. There's a tiny bit of JQuery in the <a href="_includes/header.njk">header.njk</a> template to color links on hovering with cycling colors consistently. If JS is disabled this feature does not work.</p>
<p><strong>11ty</strong> has later been added for removing boilerplate and speedup development.</p>
<p>Posts can be written either in Markdown or HTML, I usually write them with <strong>Emacs org-mode</strong>, export them in markdown and adjust what's needed. Example posts can be found in <a href="example_posts">example_posts</a>.</p>
