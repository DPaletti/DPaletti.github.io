        <div class="about-text"> I have always tinkered around with computers. I came close to the
            <b> open-source</b> community
            at age 12 with the Slackware Linux Project, and since then, I have always sought opportunities
            to build technologies that could have a <b>positive impact</b> on people's lives. My interest in
            technology was hybridized with <b> contemporary culture</b> from figurative arts to music through
            cinema and critical theory, primarily via Mark Fisher and the Cybernetic Culture Research
            Unit. Hence, the <b>civic-centered community-minded</b> approach I have today with technology.
