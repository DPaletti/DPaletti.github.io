            All these projects belong to the coursework for the 2020 Polimi neural networks course.
            These assignments were an invaluable learning opportunity.

            What
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            I built three convolutional neural networks for classification, segmentation, and visual question answering.
            The classification task involved deciding whether someone was wearing a mask or not.
            The segmentation task was part of a Europe Horizon 2020 challenge and required me to segment crops for precision agriculture.
            Finally, the visual question-answering setting provides an image and a question you need to answer given the image content.            </p>

            How 
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            All the problems have been solved with Python and Keras. 
            PIL and OpenCV have been used for image pre-processing.
