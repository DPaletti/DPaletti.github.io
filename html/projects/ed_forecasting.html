            Why  
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            This project has been developed as a research assignment for one of my last BSc courses at Polimi.
            I was required to study "Forecasting: Principles and Practices" 
            by Rob J. Hyndman and apply all the techniques to electricity demand data provided by ABB.

            What
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            I analyzed the data, plotted and built forecasting models both for single floors and for whole buildings.
            Hierarchical models have been used for forecasting full building demand.

            How 
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            The project has been implemented in R and used the forecast and hts (hierarchical time series) packages.
