            Why  
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            Black-box functions modeling is crucial in many optimization problems.
            However, the number of function evaluations is often limited
            by time or cost, as in Design Space Exploration (DSE).
            The literature mainly exploits genetic algorithms that,
            while effective in solving DSE, 
            require several calls of expensive fitness functions (FTFNs), 
            such as synthesis and place&route. 
            Therefore, approximating these black-box calls would
            incredibly impact the final results.

            What
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            We propose several
            improvements to existing DSE methodologies leveraging 
            online learning models for an open-source approach 
            generally applicable to FTFNs approximation.
            Through Adaptive Hoeffding Trees as surrogate models
            and Multi-Armed Bandits as controllers, 
            our approach decides at each iteration 
            whether to evaluate the real function or the
            surrogate model by annotating the FTFN. 
            The proposed approach achieves a top speedup of 2.67x 
            over the non-approximated DSE while delivering solutions comparable with the Pareto-optimal ones.

            How
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
        Movado is implemented in pure python and exposes an annotation to the end-user.
        Such annotation can be placed on any fitness function to map 
        an exact optimization worflow to an approximated one.
        MABs are implemented with the VowpalWabbit library.
        Hoeffding trees are implemented with the River library.
