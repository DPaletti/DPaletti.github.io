            Why  
        </span>
        <p>
            On April 2016 slock.it starts a venture capital DAO, called The DAO. Two months later an
            attacker exploits a recursive calling vulnerability and steals $55 million from The DAO in front
            of anyone who cares and cannot be stopped.
            From that moment on, security and verification in smart contracts becomes a central topic.

            What
        </span>
        <p>
            I employed colored petri networks to model and verify two smart contracts. 
            The first contract is Pyramid: an example of a fraudolent pyramidal scheme.
            The second contract is WETH9: a contract which allows to convert ETH in wETH tokens.
        </p>

            How
        </span>
        <p>
            Colored Petri Networks have been implemented with CPN-tools and the verification code has been written in ML.
