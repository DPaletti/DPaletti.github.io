            Why  
        </span>
        <p class="body-text" style="margin-left: 10vw; ">
            This project was part of the required coursework for the "Middleware Technologies for Distributed Systems" course at Polimi.
            This was an invaluable opportunity to learn the inner functioning of an Internet of Things (IOT) system.

            What
        </span>
        <p class="body-text" style="margin-left: 10vw; ">
            Each actor wears an IOT device which sends its position to a centralized server.
            I implemented an actor system to trace contacts among IOT devices.

            How 
        </span>
        <p class="body-text" style="margin-left: 10vw; ">
            The actor system has been implemented in Scala through Akka.
            The Contiki VM takes care of the IOT simulation together with COOJA.
            Communication is handled through Mosquitto.
