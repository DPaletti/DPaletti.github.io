            Why  
        </span>
        <p>
            This project was part of the required coursework for the "Middleware Technologies for Distributed Systems" course at Polimi.
            It was an invaluable occasion to learn Kafka and Node Red.

            What
        </span>
        <p>
            I built two custom nodes for Node Red to model distributed message producers and consumers. 
            These two nodes allow distributed flows between two or more devices.

            How
        </span>
        <p>
            The nodes have been implemented in Javascript. 
            The queues are handled through Kafka.
