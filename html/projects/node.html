            Why  
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            This project was part of the required coursework for the "Middleware Technologies for Distributed Systems" course at Polimi.
            It was an invaluable occasion to learn Kafka and Node Red.

            What
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            I built two custom nodes for Node Red to model distributed message producers and consumers. 
            These two nodes allow distributed flows between two or more devices.
        </p>
        <span class="second-level-header">
            How
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            The nodes have been implemented in Javascript. 
            The queues are handled through Kafka.
