            Why  
        </span>
        <p>
            This project was part of the required coursework for the "Middleware Technologies for Distributed Sytems" course at Polimi.
            It has been an invaluable opportunity to learn OpenMPI.

            What
        </span>
        <p>
            I built a multi-threaded simulation model for Covid diffusion.
            The model takes into account a population moving randomly in a given space.
            When two individuals are close for 10 or more minutes one of them is infected.
            An individual is infected for 10 days and once they become healthy they stay immune for 3 months.
        </p>

            How <br>
        </span>
        <p>
            The simulation was built with C++ and OpenMPI.
