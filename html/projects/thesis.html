            Why  
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            We are in the middle of a climate crisis,
                renewable energies must readily be implemented in the power grids. 
                However, solar and wind power integration in the grid is challenging, 
                their production depends on the weather, 
                and our overall storage capacity is insufficient. 
                We think artificial intelligence can assist grid operators in tackling these new challenges.

            What
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
        I developed a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning system.
            Each agent in the system is a reinforcement learning agent 
            and perceives its environment through a graph neural network. 
        The environment is a power grid modelled as a graph.

            How <br>
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            The whole system is implemented in Python and the reinforcement learning 
            agents are implemented from scratch with Pytorch.
            I scaled the system to almost 40 agents by running them concurrently with <a href="https://www.ray.io/" class="hyperlink">Ray</a>.
