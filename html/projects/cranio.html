            Why  
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            This is my BSc capstone project.
            It was a great opportunity to learn Java, networking and GUI development. 
            </p>

            What
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            We implemented a tabletop game called Adrenalina as an online multiplayer game.
            The game has many complex rules which required careful abstraction design.
        </p>
        <span class="page-title">
            How
        </span>
        <p class="body-text viewport-margin">
            We implemented the whole project in Java as a model-view-controller.
        </p>
