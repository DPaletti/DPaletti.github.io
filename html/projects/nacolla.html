            Why  
        </span>
        <p>
            I needed a framework that let me easily translate the block schemes I drew on paper into programs.
            The main aim was building a framework which allowed experimentation
            while forcing the system designer to think in terms of interfaces
            and abstractions.
            Initially this framework has been developed to extend

            What
        </span>
        <p>
            I developed a flow-based programming framework.
            The flows are described declaratively and steps are isolated from one another.
            Steps are single input single output processing units which are declaratively linked together. 
        </p>
        <span class="second-level-header">
            How <br>
        </span>
        <p>
            The whole framework is implemented in python and uses type-hints to validate the flow (i.e. to check interface compatibility).
            Data is routed with single dispatching.
