            Why

        <p class="body-text" style="margin-left: 10vw; ">
            I needed a framework that let me easily translate the block schemes I drew on paper into programs.
            The main aim was building a framework which allowed experimentation
            while forcing the system designer to think in terms of interfaces
            and abstractions.
            Initially this framework has been developed to extend

            What
        </span>
        <p class="body-text" style="margin-left: 10vw; ">
            I developed a flow-based programming framework.
            The flows are described declaratively and steps are isolated from one another.
            Steps are single input single output processing units which are declaratively linked together.

            How <br>
        </span>
        <p class="body-text" style="margin-left: 10vw; ">
            The whole framework is implemented in python and uses type-hints to validate the flow (i.e. to check interface compatibility).
            Data is routed with single dispatching.
