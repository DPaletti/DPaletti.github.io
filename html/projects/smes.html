            Why  
        </span>
        <p class="body-text" style="margin-left: 10vw; "> 
            Many people share e-scooter rides which makes them a very dangerous vehicle.
            Therefore, detecting the weight and the number of people on a scooter
            before the ride begins is extremely important.

            What
        </span>
        <p class="body-text" style="margin-left: 10vw; ">
            I analyzed the data coming from a set of sensors installed on the scooters.
            I built a time-series analysis pipeline and a 
            model to learn passenger weights and whether two people were sharing a ride.            </p>

            How <br>
        </span>
        <p class="body-text" style="margin-left: 10vw; ">
            The project is implemented in pure Python. SKlearn has been used for the model 
            and TSFresh for time-series windowing. 
            Sensor signal analysis has been performed with Numpy and Scipy.
