# My Personal Website
[danielepaletti.com](https://www.danielepaletti.com)
 
This **website works without JS**.


Everything has been developed from scratch with **CSS and HTML**. There's a tiny bit of JQuery in the [header.njk](_includes/header.njk) template to color links on hovering with cycling colors consistently. If JS is disabled this feature does not work.

**11ty** has later been added for removing boilerplate and speedup development.

Posts can be written either in Markdown or HTML, I usually write them with **Emacs org-mode**, export them in markdown and adjust what's needed. Example posts can be found in [example_posts](example_posts).
